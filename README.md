# OOP Puzzles


##Things to note

1) You can use any mainstream object oriented language of
your choice, so long as your solution builds and runs on linux. You
should be fine if you favour say, Java, Ruby, Python or Javascript.

2) Please ensure that you follow the syntax and formatting of both the
input and output samples. We validate submissions using automated
tests.

3) We are really, really interested in your object orientated
development skills, so please solve the problem keeping this in mind.

4) Unit tests are mandatory, so please ensure that all your code has
tests/specs.

5) Please ensure that the coding conventions, directory structure and
build approach of your project follow the conventions set by popular
open source projects in the language that you're using.
